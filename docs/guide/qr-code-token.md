# QR Code Canarytoken

## What is a QR Code Canarytoken

This Canarytoken works by encoding a URL as a QR code. When the QR code is scanned and the URL is loaded, the Canarytoken sends an alert.

## Creating the Canarytoken

Create a Canarytoken by choosing "QR Code" from the Canarytokens list.

Leave a reasonable comment to remind yourself where you will deploy the Canarytoken.

The QR image can be downloaded and placed wherever you like.

## Where to tokenize

A few ideas for use include: putting the code on containers in secure locations; on your desk; or underneath your phone battery when crossing international borders.
