# WireGuard Token

## What is a WireGuard token?

The WireGuard Canarytoken allows you to add a “fake” WireGuard VPN endpoint on your device in
seconds. If your device is compromised, a knowledgeable attacker is likely to enumerate VPN
configurations and try to connect to them. With the WireGuard Canarytoken, if this happens, you receive
an alert. This can be useful at moments like national border crossings when devices can be seized
and inspected out of sight.

## Creating a WireGuard token

Head on over to [canarytokens.org](https://canarytokens.org/generate) and select `WireGuard VPN`
Canarytoken:

Enter your email address along with a reminder on where it's installed then click Create.

You can then scan the QR Code with a phone using the WireGuard app to automatically configure the VPN
endpoint. Alternatively, you can copy the WireGuard config to any other device like a laptop or
server with WireGuard installed.
