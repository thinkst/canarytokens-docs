# Unique email address Canarytoken

## What is the Unique email address Canarytoken

This Canarytoken will alert if an attacker ever sends an email to a unique address we give you.

## Using a Unique email address Canarytoken

Create a Canarytoken by choosing the "Unique email address" tile. 

Once you've created the Canarytoken, we'll provide you with a unique email address, if it's used, we'll let you know.

You could place the token in a database with a `USERS` table, drop a fake record in there with this email address. If it gets triggered you know someone has accessed your data.
