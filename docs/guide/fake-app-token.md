# Fake App Canarytoken

## What is a Fake App Canarytoken

This Canarytoken works by being installed on your device as a Progressive Web App (PWA) disguised as a normal app. When the app is opened, the Canarytoken sends an alert.

If you allow location access, then the alert will contain the device's location when the app was opened.

## Creating the Canarytoken

::: warning Note
We currently **only** support Safari and Google Chrome.
:::

Create a Canarytoken by choosing "Fake App" from the Canarytokens list.

Select the icon you want to use for the app.

Leave a reasonable comment to remind yourself where you will deploy the Canarytoken (e.g. "Fake PayPal app on Alice's phone").

Tap the "Get Fake App Canarytoken" button and follow the installation procedure for your platform.

## Where to tokenize

A few ideas for use include: thwarting scammers with a fake banking app, catching someone snooping on your phone with a fake password manager / email app, or covertly sending your current location to someone.
