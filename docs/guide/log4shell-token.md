# Log4shell Canarytoken

## What is the Log4shell Canarytoken

This Canarytoken will alert if log4j logline is consumed by a vulnerable log4j library.

## Using a Log4shell token

Create a Canarytoken by choosing the "Log4shell" tile. 

Once you've created the Canarytoken, we'll provide you with a log4j snippet you can copy to test your systems for the log4shell issue.
If the log line is consumed by a vulnerable log4j library, it will generate an alert on this token.
If this works, you will also obtain the hostname of the vulnerable server.
