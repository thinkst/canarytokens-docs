# Fast Redirect Canarytoken

## What is a Fast Redirect Canarytoken

This Canarytoken is similar to the HTTP Canarytoken but the Canarytoken redirects to a custom address once triggered. The difference between the regular HTTP Canarytoken and the Fast Redirect is that this Canarytoken does not collect browser nor browser plugin information. For a redirect that does, see the Slow Redirect Canarytoken in the next section.

## Creating the token

Create a Canarytoken by choosing "Fast Redirect" from the Canarytokens list.

Leave a reasonable comment to remind yourself where you will deploy the Canarytoken. Add the redirect URL to which the Canarytoken will redirect once fired. Then click "Create New Canarytoken" to create the Canarytoken.
