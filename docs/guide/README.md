# Introduction

## What are Canarytokens

Canarytokens are like motion sensors for your networks, computers and clouds. You can put them in folders, on network devices and on your phones.

Place them where nobody should be poking around and get a clear alarm if they are accessed. They are designed to look juicy to attackers to increase the likelihood that they are opened (and they are completely free).

## Why should you use them

Our Canarytokens are easy to sprinkle all over and forget about, until you get the notification that matters. They are super lightweight and donâ€™t require installing software or running more background processes that can slow down your PC.

Canarytokens are a distilled version of our much-loved [Canary product](https://canary.tools/). They are dead simple, and they work.
