# Slow Redirect Token

## What is a Slow Redirect Token

This token is similar to the HTTP token but the token redirects to a custom address once triggered. The difference between the regular Fast Redirect token and this is that this token runs a browser scanner that collects browser/plugin information.

## Creating the token

Create a token by choosing "Slow Redirect" from the drop down list.

Leave a reasonable comment to remind yourself where you will deploy the token. Add the redirect URL to which the token will redirect once fired. Then click "Create New Canarytoken" to create the token.
