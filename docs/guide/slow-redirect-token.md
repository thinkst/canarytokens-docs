# Slow Redirect Canarytoken

## What is a Slow Redirect Canarytoken

This Canarytoken is similar to the HTTP Canarytoken but the Canarytoken redirects to a custom address once triggered. The difference between the regular Fast Redirect Canarytoken and this is that this Canarytoken runs a browser scanner that collects browser/plugin information.

## Creating the token

Create a token by choosing "Slow Redirect" from the Canarytokens list.

Leave a reasonable comment to remind yourself where you will deploy the Canarytoken. Add the redirect URL to which the Canarytoken will redirect once fired. Then click "Create New Canarytoken" to create the Canarytoken.
