# CrowdStrike Client Credential Canarytoken

## What is the CrowdStrike Client Credential Canarytoken

The CrowdStrike Client Credential Canarytoken provides you with CrowdStrike Falcon API-style credentials. Leave them in private code repositories, or leave them on a security analyst's machine.

An attacker who stumbles on them will believe they are the keys to your security tooling. If they are used against the CrowdStrike API at any point, you will be alerted.

The great thing is that there’s no way for an attacker to use these credentials without setting off an alert.

## Creating a CrowdStrike Client Credential Canarytoken
