# Credit Card Canarytoken

## What is the Credit Card Canarytoken

This Canarytoken will alert whenever a transaction is made using the credit card.

We recommend placing one anywhere you store payment information. If you ever get an alert from it, you know that the data store has been compromised.

## Using a Credit Card Canarytoken

Create a Canarytoken by choosing the "Credit Card" tile. You can use any name or address in association with the card number and CVV.

You could also put it in a document with other personal information regarding e.g., travel preferences in case someone snoops around your computer.

If it's ever used, we'll notify you.
