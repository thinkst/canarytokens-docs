## What is a MS Excel Canarytoken

This is a Microsoft Excel document that will alert you whenever it is opened in Microsoft Office on Windows or macOS.

This is useful for dropping into shares that shouldn't be accessed. Create a juicy filename (employee_salaries.xlsx, passwords.xlsx), leave it lying around on a network share, on a web server, in an email, and wait for the alert to tell you there's someone snooping around.
