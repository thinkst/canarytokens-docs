# Introduction

Welcome to the official repository for Canarytokens Documentation!

This is currently a work-in-progress, and we'll be adding to the docs as we can.

To get started, clone the repository and then run the dev site with `yarn`:
```
git clone https://github.com/thinkst/canarytokens-docs.git
cd canarytokens-docs
yarn install
yarn docs:dev
```

If you get a `ERR_OSSL_EVP_UNSUPPORTED` error, export the following node option: `export NODE_OPTIONS=--openssl-legacy-provider`

## Documentation

The site is available at https://docs.canarytokens.org
